  Automates release preparation for the Calculator Plus Android app. Use this
  skill whenever the user says the app is ready for a release, asks to prepare
  a release, wants to bump the version, or says anything like "let's release",
  "prepare v2.x", "update version for release", or "generate what's new".
  This skill handles everything: finding what changed since the last release,
  asking for the new version number, updating app/build.gradle, writing the
  CHANGELOG.md entry, writing docs/whatsnew/whatsnew-en-GB, having the user
  review both texts, and then committing and pushing once they approve.

# Calculator Plus — Release Preparation

You are preparing a new release of the Calculator Plus Android app. Follow
every step below in order. Do not skip steps or reorder them.

**Project root:** `C:\Users\pc\Documents\github\Calculator-Plus`

---

## Step 1 — Find the last released version

Read `CHANGELOG.md`. The first `## vX.Y.Z` heading is the last released
version. Note this version string (e.g. `2.7.0`).

---

## Step 2 — Find the baseline commit

You need the commit that represents the start of work *after* that last
release so you can collect only the new changes.

Try in order until one works:

1. Check for a git tag matching the version:
   ```
   git tag --list "v{last_version}"
   ```
   If it exists, use it as the baseline: `git log v{last_version}..HEAD --oneline`

2. If no tag, search the git log for the CI version-bump commit for that
   version:
   ```
   git log --oneline --grep="bump version to {last_version}"
   ```
   Use the hash of that commit as the baseline:
   `git log {hash}..HEAD --oneline`

3. If still nothing, use the full `git log --oneline` and visually find the
   last release boundary (look for a "bump version to {last_version}" commit).

---

## Step 3 — Collect all commits since the baseline

Run:
```
git log {baseline}..HEAD --oneline
```

Filter out these — they carry no useful changelog information:
- `ci: bump version to X.Y.Z` commits
- Merge commits (`Merge branch ...` / `Merge pull request ...`)

For every remaining commit (feat, fix, build, refactor, chore, docs, UI),
get the full detail:
```
git show {hash} --stat
```
For commits that touch source files (not just docs/config), also read the
full commit body:
```
git log -1 {hash} --format="%B"
```

Build a map of:
- What user-visible things changed (new features, bug fixes, UI tweaks)
- What internal/build things changed (toolchain, ProGuard, CI)
- Exact version numbers of upgraded dependencies

---

## Step 4 — Determine the new version

Look at the current `versionName` in `app/build.gradle`
(`defaultConfig.versionName`). This may already be ahead of the last
release if the user bumped it manually.

Apply this logic to suggest the next version:
- Any `feat:` commit (new user-visible feature) → bump the **minor** version
  (e.g. 2.6.x → 2.7.0)
- Only `fix:`, `build:`, `chore:`, `ci:` commits → bump the **patch** version
  (e.g. 2.6.0 → 2.6.1)

Show the user:
- Last released version: `vX.Y.Z`
- Current versionName in build.gradle: `X.Y.Z`
- Suggested new version: `X.Y.Z` (with one-line reason)

Ask: **"What should the new version number be?"**

Wait for the user's answer before proceeding.

---

## Step 5 — Update versionName in app/build.gradle

Edit `app/build.gradle`. Find the line inside `defaultConfig {}`:
```
versionName "X.Y.Z"
```
Change it to the version the user confirmed.

**Never touch `version.properties`** — `VERSION_CODE` is managed exclusively
by CI via the `bumpVersionCode` Gradle task.

---

## Step 6 — Write the CHANGELOG.md entry

Insert a new section at the top of `CHANGELOG.md`, immediately after the
`# Changelog` heading and before the previous `## vX.Y.Z` section.

### Format rules
- Plain technical markdown — **no emojis**
- Group under these headings (omit any with no entries):
  - `### New Features`
  - `### Bug Fixes`
  - `### UI`
  - `### Build & Toolchain`
  - `### Dependencies`
  - `### CI & Tooling`
- Be specific: include file names, class names, method names, and exact
  version numbers (e.g. `AGP 9.2.0 → 9.2.1`, not just "upgraded AGP")
- For bug fixes, include the root cause in one sentence (commit bodies
  usually have this — use them verbatim if clear)
- Skip all `ci: bump version to X.Y.Z` commits entirely
- Skip merge commits
- Add a `---` divider after the new section to separate it from the previous one

### Example shape
```markdown
## v2.8.0

### New Features
- Added scientific notation toggle in Settings (`SettingsActivity`,
  `AppPreference.SCIENTIFIC_NOTATION`)

### Bug Fixes
- **Theme crash on Android 16**: Migrated `BaseTheme` from
  `Theme.MaterialComponents` to `Theme.Material3.DayNight.NoActionBar` —
  `MaterialToolbar` requires `colorSurfaceContainer` which M2 does not define

### Build & Toolchain
- Upgraded AGP 8.11.1 → 9.2.0; Gradle wrapper 8.13 → 9.4.1
- Enabled R8 minification and resource shrinking; APK size 14.85 MB → 4.72 MB

### Dependencies
- `firebase-bom` 34.0.0 → 34.13.0
- `play-services-ads` 24.5.0 → 24.8.0

---
```

---

## Step 7 — Write docs/whatsnew/whatsnew-en-GB

This file is published to the Google Play Store and read by end users.

### Rules
- **4 to 6 bullet points maximum**
- One emoji at the start of each line
- First line is always: `🎉 Calculator Plus vX.Y.Z is here!`
- Then a blank line, then the bullets
- Each bullet: `emoji Short label — one plain sentence`
- **No technical jargon** — no class names, no library names, no build terms
- **Do not mention** toolchain upgrades, ProGuard, Gradle, Kotlin, AGP,
  dependency version bumps, CI changes, or anything a non-developer would
  not recognise
- Focus on what a user would notice: new features, visible UI changes,
  performance improvements, crash fixes, new Android version support
- Read the existing file first and match its tone and brevity exactly

### Example
```
🎉 Calculator Plus v2.8.0 is here!

✨ Scientific notation — results now display in scientific format when needed
📱 Android 16 support — fully compatible with the latest Android
⚡ Faster & lighter — app loads quicker and takes less storage
🔧 Under the hood improvements for better stability and performance
```

Overwrite the entire file with the new content.

---

## Step 8 — Have the user review the release notes

Both texts are published: the CHANGELOG entry becomes the GitHub Release body
and the what's new file becomes the Play Store release notes. The user must
read and approve them before anything is committed.

Show **verbatim**, in full:

1. The complete new `## vX.Y.Z` section you wrote in `CHANGELOG.md`
2. The complete contents of `docs/whatsnew/whatsnew-en-GB`

Then ask: **"Is the changelog and what's new text correct, or do you want
anything changed?"**

- If the user asks for edits, apply them, show the changed text again, and ask
  again. Repeat until they approve.
- Do not move to Step 9 until the user has explicitly approved both texts.
- Approval of one is not approval of the other — if they only comment on one,
  ask about the other before proceeding.

---

## Step 9 — Get permission, then commit and push

Show a concise summary of every file changed:

1. `app/build.gradle` — `versionName` updated to `X.Y.Z`
2. `CHANGELOG.md` — new `## vX.Y.Z` section added at the top
3. `docs/whatsnew/whatsnew-en-GB` — updated for the new release

Then ask: **"Shall I commit and push these changes?"**

Only if the user says yes:

1. Stage **only** those three files — never `git add -A`, and never stage the
   untracked `.idea/` or `.vscode/` files
2. Commit:
   ```
   chore: prepare release vX.Y.Z
   ```
3. Push to `main`

Then tell the user two things:

- Pushing to `main` triggers `auto-bump.yml`, which adds its own
  `ci: bump version code to N (vX.Y.Z)` commit. This is expected. Confirm
  afterwards that `versionName` is still `X.Y.Z` — if it changed, the Fastlane
  `bump` lane has regressed and is writing `versionName` again
- The release itself is still manual: they trigger the `App Release` workflow
  from the Actions tab, which builds the AAB and uploads to the Play Store
  **beta** track

---

## Hard rules

- Never edit `version.properties` — CI owns `VERSION_CODE`
- Never run `./gradlew bumpVersionCode` — CI does this during the release workflow
- Never commit or push before the user has approved both texts in Step 8
- Never push without the explicit go-ahead asked for in Step 9
- Never trigger the release workflow yourself — the user does that manually
- No emojis in `CHANGELOG.md`
- No class/library/version names in `whatsnew-en-GB`
- No build tooling changes in `whatsnew-en-GB`
